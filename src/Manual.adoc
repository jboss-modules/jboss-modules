[id='introduction']
== Introduction

JBoss Modules is a standalone implementation of a _modular_
(non-hierarchical) class loading and execution environment for Java. In
other words, rather than a single class loader which loads all JARs into
a flat class path, each library becomes a _module_ which only links
against the exact modules it depends on, and nothing more. It implements
a thread-safe, fast, and highly concurrent delegating class loader
model, coupled to an extensible module resolution system, which combine
to form a unique, simple and powerful system for application execution
and distribution.

JBoss Modules is designed to work with any existing library or
application without changes, and its simple naming and resolution
strategy is what makes that possible. Unlike OSGi, JBoss Modules does
not implement a container; rather, it is a thin bootstrap wrapper for
executing an application in a modular environment. The moment your
application takes control, the modular environment is ready to load and
link modules as needed. Furthermore, modules are never loaded (not even
for resolution purposes) until required by a dependency, meaning that
the performance of a modular application depends only on the number of
modules actually used (and when they are used), rather than the total
number of modules in the system. And, they may be unloaded by the user
at any time.

[id='concepts']
== JBoss Modules concepts

There are several important terms and concepts that must be understood to
use JBoss Modules effectively.  Some of these terms might be familiar, but
their complete definition may be surprising nonetheless.

.Terms and definitions
Resource:: a data entity which may be found and read by way of a class or class loader,
represented in JBoss Modules by the [java]`Resource` interface

Class loader:: the Java entity responsible for the creation, management, and resolution
of new classes and resources

Defining class loader:: the class loader which defines a given class; this
class loader can be found by way of the [java]`Class.getClassLoader()` method

Initiating class loader:: the class loader which was used to start a class
load request; this will be the defining class loader of the class which caused
a class load operation to begin

Class definition:: the first stage of loading a new class, whereby a class name is resolved
to a sequence of bytes and registered to the JVM; the JVM also verifies the class bytes
at this time

Class resolution:: the second stage of loading a new class, whereby all the symbolic
references in the class constant pool are resolved to concrete values

Class initialization:: the third and final stage of loading a new class, whereby the
class or interface initialization method is executed (which may include executing
dynamic code to populate the initial value of [java]`static` fields)

Visibility:: the set of classes and resources that a class can directly find via its
own class loader

Module:: an encapsulated and isolated grouping of classes and resources, which can reference
(by dependency) other modules or content; a module is represented by a [java]`Module` object
and backed by a [java]`ModuleClassLoader` object

Dependency:: a reference from one module to another, which indicates that the source module
consumes some content from the target module

Module specification:: a description of a module, which includes its dependencies and
their order as well as its contents (classes and resources)

Isolation:: the concept of preventing interference between two class loaders; isolated
class loaders can (for example) have classes and packages which have the same name
as classes and packages in a different class loader from which it was isolated

Package name:: the part of a class name which precedes the final period (`.`)
character

Package:: a set of classes which have _both_ the same package name _and_
the same defining class loader

Module loader:: the JBoss Modules entity responsible for the creation, management, and
resolution of new modules

Module finder:: the portion of the module loading logic which is responsible for locating and
defining module specifications

Resource loader:: the JBoss Modules entity responsible for locating and serving class,
package, and resource data to the module class loader

[id='classpath']
=== The class path

Most Java programmers are familiar with the _class path_.  This is the set of files and
directories which comprise a typical Java program, usually given in a long list on the
command line.  These classes are all loaded by the same class loader, known as
the _application class loader_.

The application class loader uses a _parent-first_ loading methodology: when a request to
load a class is received by the class loader, it first _delegates_ to the _platform class loader_,
which typically includes all the classes which are provided by the JDK itself.  If the
platform class loader cannot provide the given class, then the class path defined in the
application class loader is checked in order from start to end.

This simple system is sufficient for many simple applications.  However, the lack of isolation
between class path items can cause a variety of problems for more complex systems.

[id='as-a-concept']
=== Modules, defined

The concept of a _module_ in JBoss Modules is based on the notion of _isolated_ class loaders.
Each module is backed by a single class loader, and is comprised of a small number of _resource roots_
(for example, JAR files, or directories on the file system) in combination with a list of _dependencies_ which determine
the content from other modules that will be _imported_ in to this one.  The graph formed when all
dependencies are resolved (which may include cycles) determines what content is ultimately _visible_
to a module.

This allows the code in a module to know definitively what classes and resources it is sharing
a class loader with, which can resolve conflicts caused when (for example) more than one
version of a library must be used within the same application, or when certain libraries
need control over what other libraries it loads services or other resources from.

[id='loading']
=== The module loading process

Modules are loaded in a process which is similar (in concept) to the Java class loading process.
The module loader queries each of its _module finders_ in order, asking for a module
with the given name.  If found, the module finder may return a _specification_ object which
describes the module, which is then used by the module loader to establish the new module.
The new module contains a _module class loader_ which is then used to load the classes in the
module.

If the module finder does not find the module, the module loader may _delegate_ to another
module loader to find the module.  If there is no delegation process established for the
module loader, or the delegate module loader(s) did not find the module, then typically
an exception will be thrown.

[id='names']
=== Module names

Each module has a _name_.  This is a unique textual string that identifies the module being
loaded.

The name syntax is constrained only by the module loader in use.  The <<basic-repository,
filesystem module repository>> uses a dot-separated, reverse domain name convention which is similar to the
Java package name convention; here are some examples:

.Typical filesystem repository module names
* `org.apache.commons.logging`
* `org.jboss.remoting`
* `cglib`
* `javax.ejb.api`
* `ch.qos.cal10n`


The <<filesystem-repository,filesystem JAR repository>>
uses the absolute path name of the JAR (for example, [filename]`/opt/jars/commons-lang.jar` or
[filename]`C:\MyJars\commons-lang.jar`).  Other module loaders may use different conventions.  It is
the responsibility of each module loader or module finder to enforce any validity checks on module
names.

[id='versions']
=== Module versions

Since JBoss Modules 1.6, a module may include an optional _version_ string.
The module version is used for diagnostic purposes, and does not constrain or affect the resolution of the module graph
(contrast with OSGi, wherein the bundle version is a part of its identity and strongly affects resolution logic).

[id='version-syntax']
==== Module version syntax

A module version adheres to a strict syntax, which may described by the following grammar:

.Version string grammar
[source,abnf]
----
version         = letters-version / numbers-version

letters-version = [ version separator ] letters / numbers-version letters

numbers-version = [ version separator ] numbers / letters-version numbers

separator       = "." / "-" / "+" / "_"

letters         = 1*( letter )

letter          = ; any valid Unicode code point for which Character.isLetter(int) is true

digits          = 1* ( digit )

digit           = ; any valid Unicode code point for which Character.digit(codePoint, 10) returns a valid value
----

JBoss Modules does not enforce one single version string convention; users are encouraged to choose whatever convention
works best for their situation.  It is common, however, to use the version of the corresponding Maven
artifact for a module's version string, for modules which are based on Maven artifacts.

The following are all valid version strings:

.Valid version string examples
* `1.0.Beta3`
* `10`
* `Release9`
* `12r6u4`
* `5.9_224u5-build-2948+2017-11-04_11-32-04.003`

[id='versions-examining']
==== Examining versions at run time

Versions are represented by the [java]`Version` class in JBoss Modules.  They are `Comparable` and have a
stable sort order: short version strings sort before long version strings, and digit segments sort
before letter segments.  Letter segments are sorted in a lexical (case-sensitive) manner using the
Unicode code point of each letter.  Numeric segments are sorted by numeric value.
Separators sort in the order _empty_, '.', '-', '+', '_' (from highest to lowest).

In addition, the [java]`org.jboss.modules.Version.Iterator` class may be used to iterate the parts of a version, which
may be useful in certain dynamic or plugin based systems, or for the introduction of a local version
verification policy, in order to extract semantic information from a given version string.

When JBoss Modules runs on Java 9 or later, the module name and version will appear in the stack
trace of any exceptions, which is useful for diagnostic purposes.

[id='slots']
=== Module version slots

Version slot identifiers were used when you wish to have more than one
instance of a module in a module loader under the same name.  This may
occur when introducing a new major version of a module which is not
API-compatible with the old version but is used by newer applications.
 A version slot identifier is an arbitrary string; thus one can use just
about any system they wish for organization.  If not otherwise
specified, the version slot identifier defaulted to `main`.

When identifying a module in a string, the version slot identifier could
be appended to the module name, separated by a colon `:`.  For
example, the following two module identifier strings refer to the same
module:

* `org.jboss.remoting:main`
* `org.jboss.remoting`

The following three module identifier strings refer to different
modules:

* `org.jboss.remoting:2`
* `org.jboss.remoting:3`
* `org.jboss.remoting`

Within the Modules API, a module identifier with a slot was represented by the
`org.jboss.modules.ModuleIdentifier` class, which has the ability to
parse identifier strings as well as assemble a name or a name plus a
version slot identifier into a module identifier.

[NOTE]
====
The concept of slot names has been deprecated since version 1.5
in order to more closely align with the future Java Platform's module
system, which has only names.  Legacy module identifiers containing a slot component are transformed
into plain names in the following way:

* If the slot is `main` or is not given, the effective module name is equal to the name portion of the identifier.
* If the slot is not `main`, the effective module name is equal ot the name portion of the identifier,
followed by a colon `:` character, followed by the slot name.
* If the name portion of the identifier contains a colon `:` character, the character is escaped with a backslash `\`
so that in the final name, it is given as `\:`.
====

[id='class-loading-order']
=== Class loading order

Class loaders in Java can (for the most part) be broadly described as falling in to one of two
categories: _parent-first_ or _child-first_.

In JBoss Modules, module delegation is done graph-wise, not tree-wise, so modules generally may have
more than one "parent".  Regardless, each module loader can determine what class loading order is used, including
exotic hybrid orders wherein some dependencies are parent-first (i.e. checked before the current
module) and some are child-first (i.e. checked after the current module).  However, all of the module
loaders which are included with JBoss Modules use _child-first_ loading exclusively.

The best reason for this can be described using a simple example.  Given two modules, A and B, which each depend
on one another, like this:

.Simple cycle
image::fig-cycle.png[Module cycle,align="center"]

If both of these modules contain the same class (or, more likely, resource), then when A attempts
to load the class or resource, it will get B's version; likewise if B loads the class or resource,
it will get A's version.  Needless to say, this can be very surprising at run time, and difficult
to debug as well.  Using child-first loading, each module will see its own classes, avoiding this problem.

However, there is a reason that parent-first loading is used pervasively in the JDK's simple
class loading delegation tree.  If a library is provided by a parent class loader, then it may be
that the child class loader should not be able to load another copy of it.  Using parent-first loading
is a simple way to prefer the parent's version without affecting the child too much.

With JBoss Modules, the better solution to this requirement is to exclude the packages which contain
duplicated or undesirable resources.  The best approach here is to have care when packaging a given
module, to ensure that it does not contain redundant classes.  However, container authors will note
that this sometimes does not happen.  A container can however implement this technique on an automatic
basis, by examining dependency package names, and pruning that set of package names from the set of
packages that are to be defined by the module's own resources.

[id='defining']
== Using JBoss Modules to run an application

Since module definition is essentially pluggable, a module can be
defined in many different ways.  However, JBoss Modules ships with two
basic implemented strategies which are most commonly utilized when running
an application.

The first strategy is the <<basic-repository>>
approach.  Modules are organized in a directory hierarchy on the
filesystem which is derived from the name and version of the module.
 The content of the module's specific directory is comprised of a
simple <<descriptors,module descriptor>> and all of the content itself
(JARs or loose files).

The second strategy is the <<jar-repository>> approach.  This approach
runs individual JARs as modules.

[id='basic-repository']
=== Filesystem module repository

The filesystem module repository is a module storage format which is used
for applications which are comprised of a graph of modules.  The basis of
operation for the filesystem module repository is that modules are located
by scanning one or more _module path_ directories for a module descriptor
whose location is determined by converting the dot-separated
segments of the module name to path elements, followed by a path element
which consists of the version slot for that module (if any). This path is then
appended to each module path root in turn until a file named
[filename]`module.xml` is found within it.

The [filename]`module.xml` file format is described in the <<descriptors>> section.

[id='jar-repository']
=== JAR module repository

The JAR-backed module repository format allows individual JARs to run as modules directly.
This repository type is designed for executing JARs from the
command line as well as situations where a JAR may be deployed in a
container such as the JBoss Application Server.

Each JAR's [filename]`MANIFEST.MF` file can be used to define dependencies and
other module-related information.  In addition, JARs which are loaded by this repository
may themselves contain embedded module repositories which are visible only to that JAR.
This method of packaging has an advantage over traditional "fat" JAR approaches in that
each nested module has the full JBoss Modules isolation and linking capabilities available.

The format and meaning of the various [filename]`MANIFEST.MF` attributes are described in the
<<manifest>> section.

[id='descriptors']
== XML Module descriptors

Module loaders may, but are not required to, use an XML _module descriptor_.
An XML module descriptor file describes the structure,
content, dependencies, filtering, and other attributes of a module. This
format is highly expressive and is tailored for use by
module loaders which require the module description to
reside alongside its content, rather than inside it.

Below is an example of a module descriptor used by the JBoss Application
Server:

.Example module descriptor
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.6" name="org.jboss.msc" version="1.0.1.GA">

    <main-class name="org.jboss.msc.Version"/>

    <properties>
        <property name="my.property" value="foo"/>
    </properties>

    <resources>
        <resource-root path="jboss-msc-1.0.1.GA.jar"/>
    </resources>

    <dependencies>
        <module name="javax.api"/>
        <module name="org.jboss.logging"/>
        <module name="org.jboss.modules"/>

        <!-- Optional deps -->
        <module name="javax.inject.api" optional="true"/>
        <module name="org.jboss.threads" optional="true"/>
        <module name="org.jboss.vfs" optional="true"/>
    </dependencies>
</module>
----

Not every JBoss Modules release has a corresponding namespace.  The supported namespaces are as
follows:

.Allowed namespaces for `module.xml` files
[cols="3m,^",options="header"]
|===
|Namespace
|Version(s)

|urn:jboss:module:1.0
|1.0+

|urn:jboss:module:1.1

|urn:jboss:module:1.3
|1.3+

|urn:jboss:module:1.5
|1.5+

|urn:jboss:module:1.6
|1.6+

|===

Note that every version of JBoss Modules supports the full descriptor formats of all previous
versions, including elements that were deprecated or removed in later versions.

[id='root-element']
=== The root `module` element

The root element of the module descriptor determines what type of
module is being specified. There are two types: a regular _module_ and a
_module alias_.

Regular module descriptors have a root element named `module` from the
`urn:jboss:module:xxx` namespace. The `module` element supports the
following attributes:

.Attributes of the `module` element

[id='main-class-element']
==== The `main-class` element

A module which is defined with a `main-class` element is said to be
_executable_. In other words, the module name can be listed on the
command line, and the standard static [java]`main(String[])` method in the
named module's `main-class` will be loaded and executed.

The `main-class` element supports the following attributes:

.Attributes of the `main-class` element
[cols="m,1,^,^,4",options="header"]
|===

|Attribute
|Type
|Use
|Version(s)
|Description

|name
|string
|required
|1.0+
|The name of the main class, which must be <<visibility,visible>> from this module.

|===

This element may not contain any nested elements.

[NOTE]

The main class need not come from the module's actual resources, nor
does it need to be exported. Any public class which is visible to the
module - which includes all imported dependencies as well as all
resource roots - is a valid main class, as long as it has a method with
the signature [java]`public static void main(String[] args)`.

[id='resources-element']
==== The `resources` element

In order for a module to actually have content, you must define the
`resources` element with at least one resource root.

A _resource root_ is a specification of a location where the class
loader for a module will look for classes and resources. Each module has
zero or more resource roots, though most regular modules will contain
exactly one, which refers to the JAR file with the module's content.

It is possible to define resource roots for a module which correspond to
JAR files as well as file system directories, just like class paths.
File system directory resource roots have the additional property of
supporting the specification of native libraries, which cannot be loaded
from JAR files.

The `resources` element may contain any of the following elements:

.Child elements of the `resources` element

A path specification is a special pattern or "glob" which is compared against incoming path names
to determine if they match the specification.  JBoss Modules paths are a sequence
of names separated by a literal forward slash `/`.  A path specification allows wildcard characters
to take the place of part of the path, and is comprised of a sequence of `path` elements.

A path set is a fixed set of literal path names.  Path sets do not support wildcards, however,
they are more efficient than path specifications for large numbers of paths because an
entire set can be checked in one operation, as opposed to path specifications which must be
checked one pattern at a time.

The path set is comprised of a sequence of `path` elements.

[id='native-libraries']
=== Native Libraries

When using the default file system-backed module loader, each module
defined in the module repository has an additional resource root
automatically added to it solely for the purposes of supporting native
libraries in a module. This resource root recognizes a special directory
in each module root named `lib`.

The module class loader will search for native libraries by encoding the
current detected platform into a directory name, appending it to the
path of the `lib` directory, and testing the resultant directory for a
matching native library file. For example, imagine a module named
`org.foobar.gizmo` which contains a native library which runs on Linux
for Intel 32- and 64-bit processors. It would have a module directory
structure similar to this:

.Directory structure of a module with native libraries
----
org/
└─ foobar/
   └─ gizmo/
      └─ main/
         ├─ module.xml
         ├─ gizmo-1.0.jar
         └─ lib/
            ├─ linux-i686/
            │  └─ libgizmo.so
            └─ linux-x86_64/
               └─ libgizmo.so
----

In this case, the appropriate `libgizmo.so` will automatically be
located. On platforms without a corresponding library, no library will
be loaded.

The platform string is in the form `<osname>-<cpuname>`. The following
values may be used for the OS name:

.Allowed native operating system names
* `linux`
* `macosx`
* `win`
* `os2`
* `solaris`
* `mpeix`
* `hpux`
* `aix`

* `freebsd`
* `openbsd`
* `netbsd`
* `irix`
* `digitalunix`
* `osf1`
* `openvms`
* `ios`
* `unknown`

The following values are recognized for the CPU name:

single module with multiple resources.

[id='manifest-dependencies']
==== The `Dependencies` manifest attribute

The `Dependencies` manifest attribute specifies a comma-delimited list of module
dependencies to add to the JAR module.  The module
dependency may be located within the JAR itself, or it may be loaded from the
<<basic-repository,filesystem repository>> by way of the module path.

The dependency attribute has the following overall syntax:

[id='jar-permissions']
=== JAR Permissions

As of JBoss Modules 1.7, support has been added to allow JAR module permissions to be
specified using a standard Java EE `META-INF/permissions.xml` file.  If this file is found
within the JAR, then that file is read and the permissions that are listed therein are
used as the static permission set of the module's protection domain.  The set of permissions
may be additionally restricted, depending on the execution environment.

NOTE: While the `permissions.xml` format is based on the Java EE standard, JBoss Modules does
not require that the root element be qualified with a namespace or version attribute.

.Example of a `META-INF/permissions.xml` file

[id='jar-nested']
=== Nested module repository

JARs which are launched on the command line (or programmatically established as modules) can optionally
include a private, nested repository.

The root of this repository is the [filename]`modules` directory within the root of the archive.
Within this directory, files are laid out exactly as described in the <<basic-repository>> section,
with one difference: JAR file content is not supported, so during the assembly
of such a repository, the nested JAR must be extracted.  Note that Maven artifact resources are
supported.

NOTE: Prior to JBoss Modules 1.7, only the primary JAR given on the command line or as the main
argument to `JarModuleFinder` could contain embedded modules, and they were not private to that JAR,
being visible to other JARs in the transitive `Class-Path`.
In 1.7 and later, every JAR included in the transitive `Class-Path` can have
its own embedded module repository; `JarModuleFinder` has been deprecated in favor of
the more robust `FileSystemClassPathModuleFinder`.


[id='running']
== Running JBoss Modules

In order to actually use a modular application, JBoss Modules has to be bootstrapped in some way.
Most commonly, it will be launched directly from the command line, passing one or more command line
arguments.

The command line structure depends on the type of modular application being executed.  However, for
all modes, the structure of the command line is like this:

.Command line syntax
[source]
----
java [ <jvm option>... ] -jar jboss-modules.jar [ <option>... ] <program spec> [ args... ]

[id='security-manager']
== JBoss Modules and the Java security manager

JBoss Modules is designed to be able to easily run applications within a security manager.  The
primary benefit of the security manager is to prevent applications from being exploited for
malicious purposes, by allowing each module to define a maximum permission set that it must
adhere to.  This makes it more difficult for an attacker to cause a program to perform actions
which were not intentionally allowed.

WARNING: Using the security manager is not guaranteed to provide safety when running untrusted
code and should never be used for this purpose.  Only the operating system can provide a
sufficient level of safety in such a scenario.  In particular, if the JAR module repository loader
is used in this manner, the JAR should first be examined for embedded `permissions.xml` files as
well as `<permissions>` stanzas within any embedded module descriptors.

[id='security-manager-basics']
=== Security manager basics

The mechanism by which this is accomplished is through the specification of a _protection domain_
when module classes are defined.  The protection domain is comprised of a _code source_
and a set of permissions which are to be granted to the module.  The code source in turn
is assembled from a URL in
combination with an array of code signers.

Protection domains can be _static_ or _dynamic_.  A static protection domain has a fixed set
of permissions and can be evaluated quickly.  A dynamic protection domain requires that each
access be re-checked against the installed system `java.security.Policy` to determine what
permissions apply to that access.

The protection domain which is assigned to each class in each module is determined by the
corresponding module loader.
All the module loaders which are included in JBoss Modules use the same
general strategy: permissions are extracted from the module definition, and used to assemble
a static protection domain whose code source is the location of the resource loader which loaded
the class in question.  Code signers are extracted from signed JARs in a standard way.

[id='permission-checking']
==== Permission checking

Permissions are most commonly checked by an application, library, or the JDK using
a block of code like this:

.Permission checking example
[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
    // [ ... ]

    /**
     * Permission instance to use for our permission check.
     */
    static final Permission PERM_TO_CHECK = new RuntimePermission("getClassLoader");

    // [ ... ]

    /**
     * Perform an operation.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if a security manager is installed and the
     *     caller does not have the {@code getClassLoader} {@link RuntimePermission}
     */
    public void performOperation() throws SecurityException {
        // we can only check if there is a security manager installed
        final SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            // here's the actual permission check; throws an exception on failure
            sm.checkPermission(PERM_TO_CHECK);
        }
        // now it's safe to perform the operation

        // [ ... ]
    }

    // [ ... ]
}
----

[id='access-control-context']
==== Access control context

The _access control context_ is what determines the permission set that is applicable at the
point where the permission is checked.  It is comprised of a list of all the protection domains
that are in effect for a given calling context, which in turn is derived from the combination
of the current thread's call stack and any inherited context that was set either when the thread
was created or explicitly by way of a <<doprivileged-saved-acc,special method call>>.

The currently effective access control context can be captured by calling the
static `AccessController.getContext()` method, which returns an instance of
`AccessControlContext` which represents the access control context in effect
when that method was called.

The effective permission set used for access checks on a given access control context
is the _intersection_ of
all the permissions granted to each protection domain which is a part of the access control
context.  This means that calling a method can never grant additional permissions.

This can be a problem if a class must perform an action for which _it_ is authorized but
_its caller_ is not.  In such a situation, the class performing the action must use the
`doPrivileged` method of the `java.security.AccessController` class.

[id='doprivileged']
==== `AccessController.doPrivileged()`

When a different set of permissions is required by a given program unit, the `doPrivileged`
method must be called.  This method can run an action which returns a value, or
an action which returns a value and throws an exception, under a different access control
context than the one that is effective when the method was called.

[id='doprivileged-full']
===== Running an action with full privileges

The most common form of `doPrivileged` usage is to run a given action with the full privileges
of the class which calls the `doPrivileged` method.  This is accomplished like this, building on
the permission checking example above:

.Basic `doPrivileged` example
[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
    // [ ... ]

    /**
     * Permission instance to use for our permission check.
     */
    static final Permission PERM_TO_CHECK = new RuntimePermission("getClassLoader");

    // [ ... ]

    /**
     * Perform an operation.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException if a security manager is installed and the
     *     caller does not have the {@code getClassLoader} {@link RuntimePermission}
     */
    public void performOperation() throws SecurityException {
        // we can only check if there is a security manager installed
        final SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            // here's the actual permission check; throws an exception on failure
            sm.checkPermission(PERM_TO_CHECK);
        }
        // now it's safe to perform the operation
        // we need extra permissions to do our work!
        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
            Void run() {
                // perform the operation with full privileges
                // [ ... ]
                return null;
            }
        });
    }

    // [ ... ]
}
----

Note that we are only performing the `doPrivileged` call _after_ we've checked another permission
first.

WARNING: It is very important that the `doPrivileged` method never be used in this way
_unless_ it can be shown that the only paths to that method call all introduce a permission
check of their own which mediates access to that operation.  This is necessary in order to
avoid the possibility that such a call path would be able to circumvent one or more other
access checks.

[id='doprivileged-restricted']
===== Running an action with restricted permissions

It is sometimes the case that a method must perform an action with some limited set of
privileges.  There exists a variation of `doPrivileged` which accepts a variable number
of permissions which are to form the upper bound of permissions.  Here is an example:

[source,java]
.Restricted `doPrivileged` example
----
    // [ ... ]

    AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Void>() {
        Void run() {
            // [ ... ]
            return null;
        }
    }, null, new FilePermission("/some/restricted/path/-", "read"));

    // [ ... ]
----

Note that the second parameter should be left `null` in this case.

[id='doprivileged-saved-acc']
===== Running an action with a saved access control context

Sometimes it is necessary for a method to perform an action using an access control
context which was captured previously.  For example, a class may capture the access
control context during its constructor and use it for its operations, so that the privileges
that were in effect when the object was constructed are granted to any users of that object's
operation.

This can be accomplished using one of the `doPrivileged` variants which accept an
`AccessControlContext` as a parameter.

WARNING: Anyone can construct an access control context with as many (or as few) restrictions
as they like!  Therefore it is very important that secure code must _never_ accept an access
control object, or directly use such an object that was accepted, from untrusted sources.  It
is generally best to only use contexts that you have captured yourself using
`AccessController.getContext()` directly.

[id='security-manager-discovery']
=== Security manager discovery

When starting with the `-secmgr` flag, JBoss Modules will attempt to discover a security
manager implementation to use from the module of the main class.  The
`java.util.ServiceLoader` SPI mechanism is used after that module is loaded (but before it is run)
to find and instantiate the security manager to use.  If no security manager instance is found
or could be instantiated, then the default system `SecurityManager` implementation is installed.

Note that the `-secmgrmodule <module-name>` flag works in a similar manner, except that the SPI mechanism
searches the given module instead of the boot module.

[id='security-best-practices']
=== Best practices

Giving a full analysis of security manager operation in Java is well beyond the scope of this
guide.  However, there are a few basic techniques that are worth iterating which will help avoid
some common pitfalls.

.Some security manager best practices
* Always perform a permission check before running a publicly accessible method that employs
one or more full-privileged or restricted-privileged `doPrivileged` call(s).
* Never accept an access control context from untrusted code; always use
`AccessController.getContext()` from an unprivileged context to acquire a caller's context.
* Consider using restricted-permission `doPrivileged` calls when possible.
* Use constant permission objects whenever possible for permission checks and
restricted-permission `doPrivileged` calls.
* It is tempting to skip `doPrivileged` calls when a security manager is not installed; however,
this can cause problems when a security manager is installed later in execution, which can happen
in some container environments, particularly if such a call is expected to be long-running or
if the body of the call may call an operation which captures the access control context for later
use.

[id='the-api']
== Working with the JBoss Modules API

Writing applications which take advantage of the capabilities of JBoss Modules require usage
of the API. This section outlines the important constructs of the API and how to use them.

[id='modules-and-class-loaders']
=== Modules and module class loaders

Every module is backed by a `Module` instance and a corresponding `ModuleClassLoader` instance.
You can navigate from one to the other using the `Module.getClassLoader()` and
`ModuleClassLoader.getModule()` methods.  Note however that the `Module.getClassLoader()` method
is governed by the `getClassLoader` `RuntimePermission` in security manager environments.

The `ModuleClassLoader` instance is what is used by the JDK to load and link classes for a given module.
It can also be used to directly load resources and classes using the standard `ClassLoader` API.

The `Module` instance can be used to load exported classes, resources, and services from the module.

[id='module-loaders']
=== Module loaders and module finders

The `ModuleLoader` class is responsible for locating, loading, and linking modules.  The
`loadModule()` method can be used to find a module by name, returning its `Module` instance
on success.  In addition, the module loader for
a given class or class loader may be found using the static
`forClass()` and `forClassLoader()` utility methods.

A module loader may delegate the task of locating modules to one or more implementations of
the `ModuleFinder` interface, which in turn must find the module and construct its specification.

[id='boot-module-loader']
==== The boot module loader

During initialization of JBoss Modules, the _boot module loader_ is established.  This is generally
a module loader corresponding to a filesystem-backed module repository.  The boot module loader
is typically used to load from a base set of modules which is bundled with a modular application.
It can be determined by calling the static `Module.getBootModuleLoader()` method.

[id='context-class-loader']
==== The context class loader

The thread context class loader (also known as the _TCCL_) is used to identify the class loader
of the application being run.  When JBoss Modules starts up, the TCCL is initialized to the module
containing the main class.

[id='custom-module-loaders']
=== Implementing your own module loaders and finders

Plugin and deployment based systems which have a need to implement custom behavior must
generally implement their own module loaders and module finders.

In most cases, custom module loading behavior can be achieved wholly by implementing
`ModuleFinder` and using it with an instance of the base `ModuleLoader` class.

.An example of a custom module finder
[source,java]
----
/**
 * This module loader loads module content from a plugin directory.  The
 * module name is the name of the JAR minus its extension (if any).
 */
public final class PluginModuleFinder implements ModuleFinder {
    private final Path basePath;

    public PluginModuleFinder(Path basePath) {
        if (basePath == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("null basePath");
        this.basePath = basePath;
    }

    public ModuleSpec findModule(String name, ModuleLoader delegateLoader)
        throws ModuleLoadException
    {
        // 8< --- 8<
        // (construct and return the module specification)
        // 8< --- 8<
    }
}
----

NOTE: The `ModuleFinder` interface has two `findModule` methods, both of which are marked `default`.
This is because earlier versions of the API used the `ModuleIdentifier` class to locate modules.
New implementations of `ModuleFinder` should implement the `findModule` method which accepts
a `String` name, and disregard the other (deprecated) method, which may be removed in a future
release.

==== Finding and specifying a module

The custom module finder must do the work of locating the actual module, given
its name.  The module finder must construct a `ModuleSpec` for the module being built.  This
can be done by way of a `ModuleSpec.Builder`, instantiated by the `ModuleSpec.builder()` static
method.  The module specification builder has methods to set the module name, its contents, and its
dependencies, and to construct the final immutable `ModuleSpec` instance.

In our simple plugin implementation, the module name is just the name of the JAR
file without its `.jar` extension.  We also want to take some precaution to prevent clever hackers from escaping our plugin
path using an absolute path or `..` path segments.

.Finding and specifying the module
[source,java]
----
    public ModuleSpec findModule(String name, ModuleLoader delegateLoader)
        throws ModuleLoadException
    {
        // Make sure nobody escapes using a .. in the plugin name
        name = PathUtils.relativize(PathUtils.canonicalize(name));
        Path jarPath = basePath.resolve(name + ".jar");
        if (Files.exists(jarPath)) {
            ModuleSpec.Builder builder = ModuleSpec.build(name);
            // 8< --- 8<
            // (fill in the module specification)
            // 8< --- 8<
            ModuleSpec moduleSpec = builder.create();
            return moduleSpec;
        }
        return null;
    }
----

===== Resource specifications

Most (but not all) modules include some kind of content.  This can be in the form of a JAR file,
filesystem data, or simply some static in-memory content.

In our example we want to use the JAR file content for our plugin.  In this example we will
use the NIO.2 JAR filesystem API to provide the content.

.Providing the module content
[source,java]
----
            // Add the module JAR content
            URI uri = URI.create("jar:" + jarPath.toUri());
            FileSystem fs;
            try {
                fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(uri, Collections.emptyMap());
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new ModuleLoadException(e);
            }
            final Path rootPath = fs.getRootDirectories().iterator().next();
            builder.addResourceRoot(
                ResourceLoaderSpec.createResourceLoaderSpec(
                    ResourceLoaders.createPathResourceLoader("root", rootPath)
                )
            );
----

===== Dependency specifications

Modules cannot function without dependency specifications.  The module's own content as well as
the content of dependencies will only be visible to the module through adding dependencies.

The order of dependencies is significant.  Since the module's own content must be added, its
position in the order determines whether the module's class loader will behave in a parent-first,
a child-first, or a hybrid manner.

====== Including the module's own content

The module's own content can be included by adding a dependency using a specification acquired
from the no-argument `DependencySpec.createLocalDependencySpec()` method.  Let's add it in to
our example.

.Providing the module content dependency
[source,java]
----
            // Add the module's own content
            builder.addDependency(DependencySpec.OWN_DEPENDENCY);
----

[id='depending-other-modules']
====== Depending on other modules

Adding a dependency on another module within the same module loader is done using the
`ModuleDependencySpecBuilder` class in this way:

.A simple module dependency specification
[source,java]
----
DependencySpec dep = new ModuleDependencySpecBuilder()
    .setName("the-dependency-name")
    .build();
----

TIP: In versions of JBoss Modules prior to 1.7, dependencies on other modules were created
using the `DependencySpec.createModuleDependencySpec()` method.


[id='depending-other-module-loaders']
====== Depending on modules from other module loaders

Adding a dependency on a module from another module loader is done by using the
`setModuleLoader` method on `ModuleDependencySpecBuilder`.  The dependency
will be looked up from that module loader instead of the module's own loader.

TIP: In versions of JBoss Modules prior to 1.7, dependencies on modules from other module
loaders was achieved using a form of the `DependencySpec.createModuleDependencySpec()` method
which includes a `ModuleLoader` typed parameter.  In 1.7 and later, this method is deprecated.

This is useful when there is more than one way to declare a dependency, and each type must
come from a different namespace.  For example, file system JAR references might come from
a `FileSystemClassPathModuleFinder`-based `ModuleLoader`, whereas `dot.separated.names` might
come from a `LocalModuleLoader`.

This strategy can be used not only for adding dependencies on modules in different name spaces,
but also to add a dependency on your own module, even if you do not know your module's name
or even the module loader that loaded it.  Here's an example:

.Adding your own module as a dependency
[source,java]
----
            // Add my own module as a dependency
            final Module myModule = Module.forClass(getClass());
            builder.addDependency(
                new ModuleDependencySpecBuilder()
                    .setModuleLoader(myModule.getModuleLoader())
                    .setName(myModule.getName())
                    .build()
            );
----

TIP: The `ModuleFinder` interface's `findModule` method accepts a `ModuleLoader` which represents
the module loader for delegation.  If this module loader is used in a dependency specification,
it is the same as if the <<depending-other-modules,simple form>> of `createModuleDependencySpec`
is used.

NOTE: Module loaders which implement "fall-through" or "layered" delegation, where some modules
in a given namespace might be loaded from one module loader and others might be loaded from a
"parent" layer, should _not_ use this delegation strategy.  Instead, the
<<module-loader-delegation,module loader delegation>> approach should be used.

[id='depending-on-system']
====== Depending on content from the JDK

In some cases it is necessary to create a dependency to make system content visible.  This can
be done using a "local" dependency specification, for example:

[source,java]
----
DependencySpec spec = DependencySpec.createSystemDependencySpec(
    Collections.singleton("javax/smartcardio")
);
----

The given set should contain all the packages (in pathname form) that should be included
in the dependency.  No other paths will be visible to the module being built, unless they
come from other dependencies.

[id='depending-on-non-modules']
====== Depending on content from non-module sources

In rare cases it is necessary to create a dependency on some other class loader or source.  This
is accomplished using the `createLocalDependencySpec` methods which accept a `LocalLoader` instance.
These methods also require a set of path names which are to be delegated to the given dependency.

}
----

The example above is intended to be compiled into a JAR and launched either as a command-line
`-jar` to `jboss-modules.jar`, or as a module itself.

[id='module-loader-delegation']
==== Delegating to another module loader

The default behavior of the `loadModule` method of the `ModuleLoader` class is to search each of
its `ModuleFinder` instances for modules of a given name.  If the module is not found, then
a `ModuleNotFoundException` is thrown.

In cases where (for example) your module loader is acting as a "layer" over another module loader, this
behavior can be modified by overriding the `preloadModule(String)` method.  The implementation must
return a module, if one is found, or `null` if the module loader cannot find a module with the
given name.

NOTE: Module loaders which must handle multiple name spaces should _not_ use this delegation
strategy.  For example, the filesystem class path loader can load modules either by file name
(`/foo/bar/baz.jar`) from the file system module loader,
or by RDN (`org.jboss.modules`) from the local module loader.  The
name spaces do not overlap and dependencies for each are declared in separate ways.  The best
way to achieve this kind of delegation is to use <<depending-other-module-loaders,the
dependency-based approach>> instead.

To search for modules in the module loader's own module finder set, the `protected` method
`loadModuleLocal` should be used.  This method returns `null` if the module finder set does
not contain a module, and throws a `ModuleLoadException` if the module exists but failed to
be loaded for some reason (including, but not limited to, a missing dependency).

To search other module loaders for a module, your module loader must use the `protected static`
method `preloadModule(String, ModuleLoader)`.  The delegate module loader is passed in as the
second parameter.

Since JBoss Modules 1.7, there is a `DelegatingModuleLoader` class which extends `ModuleLoader` and
accepts a `ModuleLoader` and an array of `ModuleFinder` instances, and implements a the common
use case of a child-first (delegate-last) loading policy,
where the module finders are searched first before delegating to the module loader.

[id='class-loader-names']
==== Module class loader names

Since JBoss Modules 1.6, module loaders can assign a name to the class loaders of the
modules which they load.  The name will appear in stack traces and, in some cases, can appear
in log messages and other diagnostics when running under Java 9 or later.

By default, the name of the module class loader is set to the module name and version.

NOTE: Future versions of JBoss Modules may change the default, particularly as JBoss Modules
introduces direct support for JPMS integration.  The name of class loaders is purely diagnostic,
and should not be relied upon for program flow control.

You can customize the class loader name used by your module loader by extending the `ModuleLoader`
class and overriding its `org.jboss.modules.ModuleLoader.getModuleDescription` method.  The name
can be set to any arbitrary string.

[id='provided-module-loaders']
==== Using the provided module loaders and finders

JBoss Modules includes several useful module loaders and finders which it uses for its standard
operation.  These loader implementations are available for reuse.

[id='provided-local-module-loader']
===== The local filesystem module loader

The local filesystem module loader is implemented in two parts.  The bulk of the functionality
exists in the `LocalModuleFinder` class.  Instances can be constructed using the constructor(s)
found on that class, which specify the file system paths to use as the module roots (or
_module path_) and optionally a filter which may be applied to exclude certain paths from
consideration as modules.

The module finder may be instantiated and used by itself in any module loader, or it may be
used by way of the `LocalModuleLoader` class, which also has a `close` method which can be called
to release any resources used by the module finder instance.

The _boot module loader_, which is accessible by way of the `Module.getBootModuleLoader()` method,
is generally a `LocalModuleLoader`-based loader by default, unless it is explicitly overridden.

TIP: To reuse the modules from the module path, it is recommended to use the boot module loader
rather than instantiating multiple module loaders over the same paths, in order to avoid extra
memory usage and potentially hard-to-debug `ClassCastException` and similar occurrences.

[id='provided-file-system-module-loader']
===== The file system class path module loader

The filesystem (class path) module loader is used to load JAR content directly as modules, including
support for JAR- or path-embedded module repositories.

This functionality is provided by the `FileSystemClassPathModuleFinder` class.  The constructor
for this class accepts `Supplier` instances which yield module loaders for "regular" module
dependencies (like `org.jboss.modules`) and "extension" module dependencies (which are specified
in the JAR file specification, but are not presently supported by any JBoss Modules module loader
or module finder implementation).  These module loaders are used as delegates for the corresponding
dependencies.  Class path dependencies are always resolved internally.

[id='custom-module-class-loader']
==== Custom `ModuleClassLoader` subclasses

Some special environments require that the class loader be a subtype of `ModuleClassLoader`.  For
example, OSGi class loaders must implement a specific interface.

The module class loader construction process can be intercepted by providing an implementation
of `ModuleClassLoaderFactory` to the `ModuleSpec.Builder`.  Implementations of this interface
accept an opaque configuration object, which must be passed verbatim to the constructor of the
`ModuleClassLoader` class by the subclass constructor's `super()` call.

[id='resource-loaders']
=== Resource loaders

The content of a module is determined by its _resource loaders_.  Resource loaders are defined
by implementing the `ResourceLoader` interface.  A resource loader is responsible for providing
_resources_, classes, and packages, and may also be used to locate native libraries.

Each resource loader has a _root name_, returned by the `getRootName()` method of `ResourceLoader`.
The root name is used to identify a particular
resource root when a module has more than one, and should be unique per module.  It is permissible
to return an empty string `""` in the case where only one resource loader is present in a module.

The resource loader must also be able to produce its complete set of _paths_ via the
`ResourceLoader.getPaths()` method.  These paths are always `/`-separated.  This method is normally
called only once per module that the resource loader is included in.

The resource loader may optionally implement the `getLocation()` method, which provides a URI to
display for the output of management (JMX) operations.  This is sometimes useful for diagnostic
purposes.

[id='finding-resources']
==== Finding resources

The `ResourceLoader.getResource(String)` method finds resources by name.  If the resource is not
found, `null` is returned; otherwise, an instance of the `Resource` interface is returned.

The `Resource` interface in turn defines several operations.

The `getName()` method returns the resource name, and usually should reflect the exact name
that was sent in to the `ResourceLoader.getResource(String)` method.

The `getURL()` method returns a `java.net.URL` instance which contains the location of the
resource.  This `URL` object may be used by application code to read the resource content, so
it should either be an exact location, or its `URLStreamHandler` should be capable of providing
the resource content.

The `getSize()` method should return the size of the resource, if it is possible to determine.
If the size is indeterminate, for whatever reason, then `0` should be returned.

The `openStream()` method returns a non-`null` `InputStream` that efficiently yields the
content of the resource.  The caller of this method is responsible for closing the stream.  The
resource must be capable of opening the stream multiple times, and it must support multiple
streams open at the same time from the same resource.

[id='finding-classes']
==== Finding classes

The `ResourceLoader.getClassSpec(String)` method finds classes by name.  If the class is found
then an object of type `ClassSpec` must be returned, otherwise `null` is returned.

The class bytes may be set on the class specification instance by calling `setBytes()` with
a `byte[]`, or by calling `setByteBuffer()` with a `ByteBuffer`.  One of these two methods
must be called for the class load operation to succeed.

NOTE: Support for `ByteBuffer` class bytes was added in JBoss Modules 1.7.

The class specification must also have a _code source_ set on it.  The `setCodeSource()` method
may be called to set the code source.

[id='finding-packages']
==== Finding packages

The `ResourceLoader.getPackageSpec(String)` method finds information about a package.  The
implementation of this method must return a `PackageSpec` for known packages, or `null` if the
package is not known.

The attributes of the `PackageSpec` class correspond with information that normally comes from
the `MANIFEST.MF` of a JAR, including the legacy specification and implementation version information
(if any), and the package seal base URL (if the package is sealed).

[id='finding-native-libraries']
==== Finding native libraries

A resource loader has the ability to provide native library locations to the module.  Native
libraries found in this way are directly accessible to the module that includes the resource
loader.

TIP: If your resource loader must support native libraries, consider extending
<<native-resource-loader,the native resource loader>>.

To provide native library support for a module, implement the `ResourceLoader.getLibrary(String)`
method.  The implementation of this method should usually call `System.mapLibraryName(String)`
to determine the correct native library name.  The result of the method call should be the absolute
path of the location of the library on the file system.  In other words, the result of this method
may not be a JAR path, an NIO.2 non-filesystem Path, etc.

The static `NativeLibraryResourceLoader.getArchName()` method may be used to acquire a string
which may be used to help locate the correct platform native library.

WARNING: It is not recommended for general purpose applications and libraries to use this
mechanism to implement any kind of automatic native library extraction or downloads from JAR files
or other sources.  Restricted OS environments, such as link:https://selinuxproject.org[SELinux],
may forbid linkage to shared libraries that are written to disk by user applications.

[id='resource-subloaders']
==== Resource subloaders

As of JBoss Modules 1.7, a resource loader may optionally support the ability to construct a
subloader.  This capability may be used when (for example) a module loader supports more than
one module in the same JAR archive.

To provide the ability to produce sub-loaders, override the `ResourceLoader.createSubloader()`
method.  This method accepts two arguments which specify the relative path and the name of the
new resource loader.  If a name or path is not valid, or the resource loader does not support
subloaders, this method returns `null`; otherwise, it returns the new nested `ResourceLoader`
instance.

[id='iterable-resource-loaders']
==== Iterable resource loaders

As of JBoss Modules 1.2, a module loader may optionally implement the `IterableResourceLoader`
interface.  Iterable resource loaders have an additional method called `iterateResources`
which returns an `Iterator` over the `Resource` instances of the loader.

The `iterateResource` method accepts two parameters: a start path (as a string), and a flag
indicating that the iteration should (or should) not be recursive.

[id='provided-resource-loaders']
==== Using the provided resource loaders

Like module loaders, JBoss Modules includes several resource loader implementations that may
be reused.

[id='path-resource-loader']
===== The `Path` resource loader

The NIO.2 `Path` construct is supported using the `Path` resource loader.  The
static `ResourceLoaders.createPathResourceLoader()` method may be invoked to
create a new instance of the `Path` resource loader.  This method accepts two parameters:
the name of the resource root, and the `Path` that represents the base path of the
resource loader's content.

TIP: In JBoss Modules 1.4 and earlier, only file resource loaders were supported.  The
`ResourceLoaders.createFileResourceLoader()` method was used to create instances of this
resource loader using a `File` instead of a `Path`.  Since 1.5, the method is now
implemented as a special case of the `Path` resource loader.

TIP: Since Java 7, the JDK has included an NIO.2-based JAR `FileSystem` implementation which
may be used with this resource loader instead of using the <<jar-resource-loader,JAR resource
loader>> (see the <<complete-plugin-example,plugin example>>).  However, using the JAR `FileSystem`
currently consumes more CPU and memory resources than `JarFile` does; in addition, the `Path`
resource loader does not fully support JAR code signer verification.  For cases where performance
is more important than convenience, or where code signing support is required,
it is recommended to use the JAR resource loader instead.

[id='jar-resource-loader']
===== The JAR file resource loader

A special resource loader which specifically supports instances of `JarFile` is available.  To
create instances of this resource loader, call the `createJarResourceLoader`
method of the `ResourceLoaders` class.  The method accepts the resource root name and the
`JarFile` instance, and optionally, a relative path within the JAR where the content root
should be located.

[id='native-resource-loader']
===== The native resource loader

The `NativeLibraryResourceLoader` class may be used directly or extended in order to provide
module content which includes native libraries on the file system.  The constructor of this
class accepts a single `File` argument that represents the root location of the loader's content,
which may include native libraries.  The location is available from the `getRoot()` method of
that class, and it is also used for the URI value returned by `getLocation()`.

Native libraries are returned in the manner described by the <<native-libraries>> section.
